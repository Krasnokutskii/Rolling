## Conclusion 
It was an interesting project which helped me to understand how works SpriteKit and CoreMotion.  
Even though it was a basic app, it was challenging for me and takes lots of efforts to finish.
The accelerometer is a useful tool and I'm sure I'll use it more often.
I'm satisfied with the work I've done and will return to make this up even more beautiful.
